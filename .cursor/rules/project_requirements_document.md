# Project Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

This project is about building a single web page—a landing page—intended to celebrate a successful lottery draw for an awesome birthday gift. The gift is a concert ticket to a Metallica show on November 1 in Perth, Australia, featuring Evanescence and Suicidal Tendencies. The page is designed to engage and excite its audience (a person celebrating their birthday) with an interactive, modern, and elegant visual experience as soon as they land on the site.

The page is being built to provide an immersive and celebratory experience with clear sections that lead the user through the excitement of winning, learning about their reward, and finally confirming their participation via a simple form. The key objectives include a dynamic full-screen layout for desktop and mobile, smooth manual navigation via buttons, engaging animations (like confetti explosions), and a straightforward form submission that validates their participation—all without the need for a backend.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   A landing page with three distinct, full-screen sections:

    1.  Lottery draw success with animated confetti.
    2.  Detailed description of the concert ticket, complete with background image and descriptive text.
    3.  A simple identification form with three fields (nom, prénom, email).

*   Manual navigation between sections via clearly labeled buttons.

*   Animated transitions and interactive hover effects on buttons and titles.

*   Responsive design that adapts to both smartphones and desktop screens.

*   Deployment on Netlify using basic frontend technologies (JS, CSS, HTML).

*   A popup confirmation on form submission, followed by a page reload.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Backend integration or authentication systems.
*   Advanced server-side processing or database interactions.
*   SEO or accessibility enhancements beyond standard best practices.
*   Additional sections or multi-page flow. The project is strictly a single-page landing experience.

## 3. User Flow

When a user lands on the page, they are immediately greeted with the first section that shows the successful lottery draw. The section fills the entire screen and features an engaging animation where confetti bursts across the display. A prominent button is available for the user to continue to the next section once they are ready.

Upon clicking the navigation button, the user manually moves to the second section. Here they find detailed information about the prize—a concert ticket with specified details, supported by a striking background image that portrays the heavy metal atmosphere. Interactive hover effects embellish the elements during mouse over. Finally, another button takes the user to the third section, where a minimalistic and clear form is shown to capture their first name, last name, and email. After filling in the details, a submission triggers a popup confirmation. Once acknowledged, the page reloads to confirm the process and maintain a tidy, one-page experience.

## 4. Core Features

*   **Section 1: Lottery Draw Display**

    *   Full-screen section with an animated confetti explosion to celebrate the win.
    *   A clear and inviting navigation button to proceed to the next section.

*   **Section 2: Gift Description**

    *   Displays details of the gift: concert ticket for Metallica on November 1 in Perth, Australia with additional musical acts.
    *   Uses a striking background image sourced from an external URL.
    *   Includes descriptive text along with interactive hover effects on titles and clickable elements.

*   **Section 3: User Identification Form**

    *   A simplified form with three fields: nom, prénom, and email.
    *   On form submission, a popup confirms successful input, followed by a page reload to complete the process.

*   **Manual Navigation**

    *   Navigation between sections via clearly labeled buttons for a controlled flow.

*   **Responsive Design**

    *   Ensures a consistent and appealing experience whether viewed on a smartphone or a desktop.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Frontend Technologies:**

    *   JavaScript
    *   CSS
    *   HTML

*   **Hosting & Deployment:**

    *   Netlify

*   **Libraries/Frameworks:**

    *   Any light-weight JS libraries for animations (if needed, e.g., for confetti effects)
    *   Pure CSS and JavaScript for responsive and interactive elements

*   **Design & IDE Tools:**

    *   Gemini 2.5 Pro (for advanced problem solving in design and logic)
    *   Cursor (an advanced IDE for AI-powered coding with real-time suggestions)

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:**

    *   The page must load quickly with minimal animations lag.
    *   Animation effects (confetti, hover states, transitions) should be smooth and not cause delays.

*   **Security:**

    *   Since there is no backend or authentication, client-side validation on the form will be in place to prevent incorrect submissions.
    *   Use HTTPS as provided by Netlify hosting.

*   **Usability:**

    *   The navigation design must be intuitive, with clear buttons on each section.
    *   Interactions must be responsive both on mobile and desktop.

*   **Design:**

    *   Must adhere to a modern, elegant aesthetic suitable for a heavy metal concert theme.
    *   Smooth transitions and hover effects enhance the feel without overwhelming the user.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   The project is entirely frontend with no backend support.
*   Deployment is based on Netlify; therefore, server-side logic is not available.
*   Form submission is handled with a popup confirmation and page reload without data storage (unless integrated with Netlify Forms in an extended version).
*   All animations and interactions are implemented using JavaScript and CSS for compatibility.
*   The project assumes stable availability of resources such as the external image URL.
*   It is assumed that the user flow remains linear with manual navigation through buttons.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **Animation Performance:**

    *   Confetti animations and transitions must be optimized to not degrade performance on lower-end mobile devices.
    *   Consider using efficient JS libraries or CSS-based animations to minimize resource usage.

*   **Browser Compatibility:**

    *   Ensure that the design, animations, and layout are consistent across different browsers and devices.
    *   Extensive testing on both mobile and desktop is required.

*   **Form Handling:**

    *   Since there is no backend, the popup confirmation and page reload must be reliably handled on the client-side.
    *   Consider edge cases where the page may reload before the popup fully processes user input.

*   **Responsive Design:**

    *   Full-screen sections must scale properly without causing vertical scrolling issues.
    *   Thorough testing on a range of devices is necessary to maintain design integrity.

*   **External Resource Dependency:**

    *   The background image is dependent on an external URL; a fallback mechanism or caching approach should be considered in case of unavailability.

This PRD provides a comprehensive blueprint to build the landing page effectively without ambiguity. Each section, feature, and constraint is outlined to ensure clarity and ease for further technical documentation and development processes.

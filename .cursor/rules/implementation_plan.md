# Implementation plan

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1. **Prevalidation:** Check if the current directory already contains a project (e.g., look for an existing index.html or project-specific folders). (Project Summary)
2. **Directory Setup:** If not already a project, create a new project directory for the landing page. (Project Summary)
3. **Cursor Metrics Setup:**
   - In the project root, check for a `.cursor` directory; if it does not exist, create it. (Tools: Cursor IDE, Gemini 2.5 Pro)
   - Within the `.cursor` directory, check for a file named `cursor_metrics.md`; if it does not exist, create it. Then refer to the `cursor_project_rules.mdc` file for further instructions on configuring this file. (Tools: Cursor IDE)
4. **Tool Setup:** Ensure Gemini 2.5 Pro and Cursor IDE are installed and configured for your project. (Technical Details: Tools)

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

5. **HTML File Creation:** Create an `index.html` file in the project root. (Project Summary)
6. **Section Structure:** In `index.html`, create three full-screen `<section>` elements with unique IDs (e.g., `id="lottery"`, `id="gift"`, and `id="form"`). (Page Structure)
7. **Lottery Win Section:** In the `<section id="lottery">`, add content that displays the lottery win message and reserve a container (e.g., a `<div>`) for an animated confetti explosion. (Page Structure, Interactivity)
8. **Gift Description Section:** In the `<section id="gift">`, add details describing the concert ticket prize. Include an `<img>` element with the `src` set to `https://cdn.media.amplience.net/i/metallica/2025-11nov01_Perth-Australia_Square-Ad-Mat` and include descriptive text using details available from `https://www.metallica.com/tour/2025-11-01-perth-australia.html`. (Page Structure)
9. **Identification Form Section:** In the `<section id="form">`, create an HTML `<form>` that contains input fields for the user's name, surname, and email, and add a submit button. (Page Structure)
10. **Navigation Buttons:** Add manual navigation buttons (e.g., Next/Back) within each section or in a fixed navigation bar to allow for seamless movement between the three sections. (Navigation, Interactivity)
11. **CSS Styling:** Create an external CSS file at `/css/styles.css`. Link this file in the `<head>` of `index.html` and style the page to be modern, elegant, and responsive (suitable for both mobile and desktop). (Design, Responsiveness)
12. **JavaScript Setup:** Create an external JavaScript file at `/js/main.js`. Link it in `index.html` before the closing `</body>` tag. This file will handle interactivity and navigation. (Technical Details: Frontend)
13. **Confetti Animation:** In `/js/main.js`, implement a confetti animation that is triggered when the lottery win section is viewed (or on page load). Use either a lightweight library or custom animation code. (Interactivity)
14. **Smooth Transitions:** In `/js/main.js`, implement smooth transitions between sections when navigation buttons are clicked (e.g., smooth scrolling using JavaScript's `scrollIntoView` or CSS transitions). (Interactivity)
15. **Form Submission Handling:** In `/js/main.js`, add an event listener on the identification form to capture form submission. Upon submit, trigger a popup confirmation (using `alert` or a custom modal), and then reload the page. (Interactivity, Form Submission)
16. **Validation:** Open `index.html` in a browser and test the following:
    - The three full-screen sections display correctly.
    - The confetti animation triggers in the lottery section.
    - Navigation buttons cause smooth transitions between sections.
    - The identification form shows a popup confirmation on submission and reloads the page. (Project Summary, Page Structure)

## Phase 3: Integration

17. **File Linking Validation:** Ensure that `index.html` correctly references `/css/styles.css` and `/js/main.js` by checking the network log in the browser's developer tools. (Integration)
18. **Section Navigation Check:** Click through the navigation buttons to verify that each section is reachable with the implemented smooth transitions. (Integration)

## Phase 4: Deployment

19. **Repository Setup:** If not already set, create a new Git repository for your project and commit all files (e.g., `index.html`, `/css/styles.css`, `/js/main.js`, and any other assets). (Hosting: Netlify)
20. **Netlify Deployment:** Sign in to Netlify and create a new site by connecting your Git repository. Follow the prompts to deploy this static site. (Hosting: Netlify)
21. **Post-deployment Validation:** Visit the deployed Netlify URL and verify that:
    - The landing page loads correctly.
    - All sections, animations, and form functionalities work as expected. (Hosting: Netlify)

**Note:** This implementation plan adheres to the project requirement of using only frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with manual navigation. No backend infrastructure or Supabase configuration is required.

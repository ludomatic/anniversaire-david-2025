# Cadeau d'anniversaire par tirage au sort - App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
Since this landing page is publicly accessible and does not require traditional user authentication, the onboarding process is very simple. When a user visits the site via a direct link or by discovering it on Netlify, they see the landing page in its entirety. There is no sign-up or sign-in process, meaning that no accounts are created, and there is no option for password recovery. The only identification step is in the final section of the page where the user provides their name, surname, and email, solely for confirming their participation in the lottery game. This identification form is not used for authentication purposes but only to capture basic details of the game participant.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
Immediately upon landing on the page, users are greeted with the lottery result section. The page is designed to display in full screen on both smartphones and desktops, ensuring a visually impactful experience. The first section shows that the lottery was successful, complete with an animated confetti explosion that creates a feeling of celebration. A clear and prominent button is visible on this screen, inviting the user to move on to the next section once they have acknowledged the win. This starting point is the central focus of the experience, ensuring that users instinctively know where to click next to explore more details about their win.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
The application flows across three distinct sections, each designed to take up an entire screen for maximum visual impact. In the first section, as soon as the user lands on the page, an eye-catching animation with exploding confetti is triggered to announce the lottery success. This effect is paired with a vibrant design that aligns with the heavy metal and celebratory theme of the prize. When the user taps the dedicated button to continue, the view transitions manually to the second section.

The second section offers a detailed description of the prize. This part of the page highlights a concert ticket win, displaying a striking background image sourced from an external URL. The content is tailored to evoke the heavy metal vibe and is filled with details such as the concert date for Metallica on November 1st at Perth in Australia, along with additional acts like Evanescence and Suicidal Tendencies. Subtle interactive effects, including hover animations on titles and clickable areas, enhance the user experience as they engage with the presented information. Once the user has absorbed this information, another clearly marked button allows them to continue to the final part of the journey.

The third section contains the identification form. This form collects the essential details from the user – the name, surname, and email address. Designed to be as straightforward and clutter-free as possible, this section ensures the user can quickly provide the necessary data to confirm their participation. After filling in the form, the user submits it, which immediately triggers a popup confirmation message. This popup informs the user that their details have been successfully recorded. Once the user acknowledges the popup, the page automatically reloads to return to the default starting point, thus preparing the experience to be repeated or simply ending the interaction in a smooth manner.

## Settings and Account Management
The nature of this landing page does not call for a typical settings or account management area as seen in standard applications. There are no dashboards where users can change their profile information, update notifications, or manage subscriptions. The only interactive element that involves personal data is the identification form in the third section. Since there is no backend, the form merely triggers a popup confirming successful data capture, and there is no need for ongoing account management or settings adjustments. Once the interaction is complete, the user returns effortlessly to the main flow of the page thanks to the straightforward reload mechanism.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
Even though this is a simple, single-page application, error states are taken into consideration. If a user enters invalid data in the identification form, clear error messages appear next to the respective fields to prompt them for correction. In cases where network or connectivity issues are detected, the page informs the user with a concise message advising them to check their connection, although the reliance on backend processing is minimal in this scenario. The popup confirmation from the form submission provides an additional opportunity to handle errors by reinviting the submission in case of any issues. These measures ensure that even unexpected actions do not break the experience, and users are guided back to a smooth, error-free flow.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
The user journey in this landing page is designed to be engaging and celebratory from start to finish. When a new user lands on the page, they are immediately greeted with a dynamic, full-screen display announcing their lottery win through a confetti animation. This visual celebration is followed by an immersive description of the prize: an exclusive concert ticket for Metallica, complete with relevant details that underline the event’s significance. Finally, a simple yet interactive identification form lets the user confirm their participation by entering their basic details, followed by a popup that confirms successful registration before refreshing the page. The entire flow is enriched with modern animations, interactive hover effects, and fluid transitions between sections, ensuring that both mobile and desktop users have a memorable experience from the moment they arrive until the completion of the interaction.
